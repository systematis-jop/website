![Ansible Server Patching utilizing Ansible Vault](/images/ansible.jpg)


This quick guide shows how to use an Ansible playbook to patch a bunch of servers. This approach still is not fully automated, as it needs user input for the execution and provision of secrets from ansible-vault.


### Prerequisites

1. **Ansible installed**: Make sure Ansible is installed on the machine that will run the playbook. If you are on MacOS like me, just use `brew install ansible`.
2. **Vault setup**: Install and configure Ansible Vault for handling sensitive data. Find a setup instructions [here.]({{< ref "/posts/ansible-vault-setup.md" >}}) 
3. **SSH access and sudo privileges**: The user running the playbook must have SSH access and sudo privileges on the target servers.

### Step 1: Setting up an inventory file with vaulted passwords

First, we need an inventory file that defines the hosts we want to patch and includes an encrypted `become` password variable. Here's a typical structure:

1. **Create inventory file** (`inventory.yaml`):
   - Define groups or specific hosts.
   - Specify variables to hold the vaulted password information.

```yaml
    [vpn]
    ansible_host: 10.10.10.10

    [vpn:vars]
    ansible_user=user
    ansible_ssh_port=22
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ansible_become_pass='{{ vpn_become_pass }}'
```

> **Note**: The vaulted strings above are placeholders. Youâ€™ll need to create your own encrypted passwords in your vault. Also, this assumes your ssh key has already been copied to the to be patched server.

### Step 2: Writing the playbook for server patching

The playbook file, `patch_servers.yaml`, will include tasks for updating packages, cleaning up, checking for a reboot, and handling SSH keys.

```yaml
---
- hosts: hostgroup
  become: true
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
    - name: Update package cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        force_apt_get: yes
        cache_valid_time: 3600

    - name: Upgrade all packages
      apt:
        upgrade: dist

    # Step 2.3: Clean Up
    - name: Remove old packages and clean cache
      apt:
        autoremove: yes
        autoclean: yes
        clean: yes

    # Step 2.4: Reboot if Required
    - name: Check if reboot is required
      register: reboot_required_file
      stat: path=/var/run/reboot-required

    - name: Reboot if kernel updated
      reboot:
        msg: "Reboot initiated by Ansible for kernel updates"
        connect_timeout: 5
        reboot_timeout: 300
        pre_reboot_delay: 0
        post_reboot_delay: 30
        test_command: uptime
      when: reboot_required_file.stat.exists
```

### Step 4: Running the Playbook with Ansible Vault

Run the playbook with the following command, referencing the vault password file:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml patch_servers.yaml --ask-vault-pass -e@vaulted_vars.yml
```

### Explanation of Inventory File Configuration

- **Inventory File**:
  - `ansible_host`: Specifies the IP or hostname of the target server.
  - `ansible_user`: The SSH user to connect as.
  - `ansible_become_pass`: The `become` (sudo) password for privilege escalation, encrypted with Ansible Vault.

### Conclusion

That's it already. Obviously there is more automated ways to this, like setting up a HashiCorp Vault instance and any automation server that fetches the secrets from there and patches your machines regularly. I found this approach very useful though, so I am sharing it.
