My name is **Johannes** and I am a **DevOps engineer** with a deep passion for open-source software, Linux, and containerization. When I'm not working on production infrastructure, you’ll find me experimenting in my home lab, trying out the latest tools and software.

I created **systematis.ch** to document my journey, share my knowledge, and hopefully inspire others in the tech community. Whether you're here to learn, share, or collaborate, I’m glad you’ve found your way to my corner of the web.

Feel free to [contact me](/imprint).
This blog aims to be a collection of my thoughts, experiences, and tutorials on projects related to DevOps, open-source software, Linux, and containerization.
